// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
function createCar(manufacturer, model, ...options) {
    let car = {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        model: model
    };
    options.forEach(([key, value]) => {
        car[key] = value;
    });
    return car;
}
// Call the function with required information and two other name-value pairs
let carInfo = createCar('Toyota', 'Camry', ['color', 'blue'], ['sunroof', true]);
console.log(carInfo);

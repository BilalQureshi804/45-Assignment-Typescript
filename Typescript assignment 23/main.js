//ASSIGNMENT #23
//Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
//let car = 'subaru';
//console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
//console.log(car == 'subaru')
//Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
// Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to false
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
//Test 1
console.log(x > y); //check if x is greater than y (returns false)
//Test 2
console.log(x < y); //check if x is less than y (returns true)
//Test 3
console.log(x == y); //check if x equal to y (retuens false)
//Test 4
console.log(x != y); //check if x is not equal y (returns true)
//Test 5
console.log(x == y); //check if x is not equal 5 (returns true)
//Test 6
console.log(x != 5); //check if x is equal to 5 (returns false)
//Test 7
console.log(y == 10); //check if y is not equal to 10(returns true)
//Test 8
console.log(y != 10); //check if y is not equal to  10 (returns false)
//Test 9
console.log(x == 10); //check if x is equal to 10 (returns false)
//Test 10
console.log(x != 10); //check if x is not equal to 10 (returns true)
